message: "Pomeranians are cute dogs. I love furry little critters. I've met super sweet and friendly ones. And some not so nice ones. Spencer for sure sounds like a good one.\r\n\r\nMy oldest child is around the edge of Aspergers too. His relationship with his Midnight cat was really special and changed his life. I can relate to how important Spencer was to your son. My cats make the difference for me being lonely today too."
