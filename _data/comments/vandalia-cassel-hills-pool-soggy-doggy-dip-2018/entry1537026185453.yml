  What a great idea! I love that your dogs were able to enjoy a nice swim,
  especially seeing as the end of the summer season is near. I've never tried
  this with my pets. The closest I've gotten is taking them to the beach in
  their carriers.That was enough to freak them out for life so never again. LOL
  I'm glad your crew had fun though!
