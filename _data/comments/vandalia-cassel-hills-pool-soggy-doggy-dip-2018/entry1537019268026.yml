  What fun for Princess and other dogs that love swimming. Kilo the Pug is not a
  fan of other dogs or getting wet, even in mid summer. He does not enjoy bath
  or shower time or peeing outside in the rain. I have taken him to the dog
  beach we have in Toronto and he paddled briefly but then backed away quickly.
  Luckily there was enough space to keep clear of other dogs that day. I took
  him to my friend's pool and held him on the steps and let him dog paddle a
  tiny bit. He couldn't wait to get out and I am nervous with his a squishy face
  that he might get water up his nose and have issues or sink as so top heavy.
  He has a life jacket in case he comes to the lakes with us but he hates
  wearing it.
