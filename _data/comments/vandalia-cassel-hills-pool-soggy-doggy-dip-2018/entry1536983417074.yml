  I've never heard of this, but I think it's such a great idea!! Why not let the
  dogs have a fun day at the pool before it's emptied...it's brilliant. The
  pictures are adorable. I've never had a dog who liked the water, so when we go
  down to the beach he runs around the grass and we end up watching all the
  other dogs running in and out of the sea having a blast.
