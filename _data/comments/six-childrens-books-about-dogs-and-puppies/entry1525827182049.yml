  Ahh, the Pokey Puppy! Written in 1942 and still a classic. I can remember how
  excited I was to see it in the children's book section when I got pregnant
  with my son. I had read and loved it as a child and then read it to my son as
  my mom had done. Gotta love how dogs always connect us to what really matters.
