  These are all fantastic. I have the first three and will look for the last
  three. I went back through all the books my girls loved as part of our
  research for Kids' Pet Club. There is a rela benefit to kids looking at and
  learning about pets, especially cute puppies apparently. Spot was such a fave
  of ours. In the therapy dogs reading programs we filmed, the kids loved
  reading books about dogs to dogs.
