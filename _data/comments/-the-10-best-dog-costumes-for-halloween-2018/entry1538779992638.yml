  So cute!  I especially got a kick out of the shark.  I think I'm going to skip
  dressing up my dogs this year, or maybe, if anything, just reuse costumes I
  bought them from previous years.  We don't really do much to celebrate
  Halloween, but every year I do make the dogs some homemade treats.
