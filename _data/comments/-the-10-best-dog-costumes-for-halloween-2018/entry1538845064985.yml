  What a great list. Kilo has several on it including a shark costume but it is
  a bit bulky. I might get him that prisoner one as looks pretty comfy or maybe
  just reuse the Super Man or Batman ones. We usually attend a Pugoween
  Fundraiser for a local pug rescue. BTW some very talented Canadian friends
  make the Super Simple Songs videos and music including Baby Shark. A fantastic
  very inspiring YouTube success story.
