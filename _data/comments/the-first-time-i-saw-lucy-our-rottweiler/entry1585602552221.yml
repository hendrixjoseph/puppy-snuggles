  I'm so happy you were able to find the dog that best met the needs for your
  family. I felt the same way when I was ready to get some new kittens after
  losing my last cat. I love the Persian breed, but they are known for some
  health issues. I searched for a reputable breeder that lived within 5 hours
  from me so I could visit their cattery. Even though Truffle doesn't meet the
  "breed standard", her personality reached out to me from that first photo!
