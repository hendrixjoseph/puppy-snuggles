message: "The people next door to us had a guard dog that was a Rottweiller. I never got close ot it to be honest although he said it was a big softie and sounds like your little pup.\r\n\r\nI like that you went in with one idea but were prepared to change your mind when the right pup called to your heart. This is the ONLY way to go to find the pet that will be a big part of your family."
