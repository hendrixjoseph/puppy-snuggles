message: "It is always the perfect moment when you find the perfect pet and you both know it. I feel like all my cats picked me (except the one that was dropped off on me.)\r\n\r\nItâ€™s important to know what you want but be willing to change if the right pet appears but not be impulsive and just take the first thing you see."
