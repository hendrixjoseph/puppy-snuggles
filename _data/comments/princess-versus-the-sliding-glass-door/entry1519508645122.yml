msg: "Yikes!!  Poor Princess, that is so awful.  Our Husky Icy used to run into the back sliding screen door, thankfully she never ran through the glass!  We determined that she just couldn't see all that well and didn't realize the screen door was shut.  It was awful to see, but it pales in comparison to what Princess went through.  I started putting color duct tape on the doors after that, which seemed to help.\r\nLove & Biscuits,\r\nDogs Luv Us and We Luv Them"
