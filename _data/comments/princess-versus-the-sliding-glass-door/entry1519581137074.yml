  Princess was so lucky!  When I was about 12, our Bullmastiff ran through a
  sliding glass window.  She cut an artery in her leg.  Fortunately, my dad was
  a doctor and was able to slow down the bleeding while they drove her to the
  vet.  The emergency vet couldn't believe she survived, but thankfully she
  did.  She had a big splint on her leg for a couple of weeks.
