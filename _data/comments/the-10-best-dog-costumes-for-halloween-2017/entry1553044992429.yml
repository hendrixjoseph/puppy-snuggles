msg: "Today, I went to the beach front with my kids. I found \r\na sea shell and gave it to my 4 year old daughter and said \"You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.\" She put \r\nthe shell to her ear and screamed. There was a \r\nhermit crab inside and it pinched her ear. She never wants to go back!\r\nLoL I know this is completely off topic but I had \r\nto tell someone!"
