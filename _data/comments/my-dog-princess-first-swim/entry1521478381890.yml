msg: "You're so lucky to have a \"water dog\"!  My dogs don't particularly like the water, unfortunately.  My Husky will go in up to her belly if the water is very calm but my little one avoids it like the plague.  A life jacket is a must for dogs in the water, especially the first few times they go in, or if they're going in the ocean with waves. Your dog is so adorable!\r\nLove & Biscuits,\r\nDogs Luv Us and We Luv Them"
