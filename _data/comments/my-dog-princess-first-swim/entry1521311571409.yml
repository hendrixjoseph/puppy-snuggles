  We have two dogs that are unsure about water, they will paddle but I've never
  seen them swim! Barney threw himself into a pond when he was 6 months old and
  then tried to get towards the edge to get out and couldn't because of reeds,
  it really scared him, and me, my husband had to go in and get him out... he's
  never forgotten it and only just started paddling in water!
