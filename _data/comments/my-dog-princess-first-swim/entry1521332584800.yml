  Great job, Princess. I remember the first time Jasmine swam ... not really on
  purpose, when she got into the water "too deep" and her body started swimming.
  You could see the "what the heck?" expression on her face as she immediately
  turned back to the shore unimpressed with he body having its own mind. I also
  remember the first time she swam on purpose after that ... when she saw a leaf
  floating in a bay and decided to go and get it.
