I've been using Movable-type on several websites for about a year and am nervous about \r\nswitching to another platform. I have heard fantastic things about blogengine.net.\r\nIs there a way I can import all my wordpress posts into \r\nit? Any help would be really appreciated! http://skrun.ch/J9TfkhL"
