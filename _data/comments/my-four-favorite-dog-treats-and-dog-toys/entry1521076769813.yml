I understand this is sort of off-topic but I had to ask.\r\nDoes managing a well-established website such as yours take a massive amount work?\r\nI am brand new to blogging but I do write in my diary \r\nevery day. I'd like to start a blog so I can share my own experience and \r\nviews online. Please let me know if you have any ideas or tips for brand new aspiring \r\nbloggers. Thankyou! http://www.myvidster.com/profile/JimGriffin"
