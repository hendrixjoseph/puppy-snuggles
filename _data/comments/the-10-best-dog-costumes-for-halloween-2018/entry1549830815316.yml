msg: "Watch ought to have a message page. Websites ranging in proportions and \r\nclass originating from a local restaurant to your Fortune 500 \r\ncompany, have contact pages. Inside my current \r\nstartup I have seen an array of requestsâ€¦ from your \r\npizza delivery guy letting us know he was at the cab \r\nend door to potential investors looking to communicate with his management team.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you're setting increase contact page (and finding the traffic volume of a local restaurant) you possibly will not be \r\nthinking about how to regulate your contact requests when site traffic increases.\r\nAnd you should.\r\n\r\nLook at configuring automation that alerts support, sales or any other stakeholders as part of your company when a contact request \r\ncomes through. You can create a dropdown field in a questionaire for sorts of contact requests.\r\nIt is possible to setup logic in many marketing automation platforms that sends email \r\nalerts to the suitable resource with your startup dependant on what type of request the viewer selects.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'd been buried with contact requests even as launched beta.\r\nBeing a cloud-based product I saw many product support \r\nrequests. And we all mapped form submissions on our contact page \r\nto create support tickets in Zendesk.\r\n\r\nMake sure that you put in place redundancies \r\nso contact requests (important ones!) don't get lost in a single recipient's inbox.\r\nYou are able to alert multiple recipients, create reminder emails, or trigger \r\nautomatic replies to contact requests with information that will solve their problem.\r\nThis is actually a breeze to put together with all-in-one marketing platforms like HubSpot."
