msg: "Look at should have a contact page. Websites ranging in space \r\nand class from a local restaurant to your Fortune 500 company, have contact pages.\r\nInside my current startup We have many requests… with the pizza delivery guy \r\nletting us know he was in front door to potential \r\ninvestors looking to talk with his management team.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you're setting your contact page (and finding the traffic volume \r\nof any local restaurant) you will possibly not be thinking about \r\nhow to regulate your contact requests when traffic \r\nincreases. However, you should.\r\n\r\nTake into consideration configuring automation that alerts support, sales as well as other stakeholders with your company when a message request comes through.\r\nYou can create a dropdown field in an application for different types of \r\ncontact requests. You may arrange logic in most marketing automation platforms \r\nthat sends email alerts to the right resource inside your startup depending on which request the viewer selects.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had been buried with contact requests when we launched beta.\r\nBeing a cloud-based product I saw many product support requests.\r\nTherefore we mapped form submissions on our contact \r\npage to develop support tickets in Zendesk.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou should create redundancies so contact requests (important ones!) \r\ndon't get lost in a single recipient's inbox. You possibly can alert multiple recipients, \r\ncreate reminder emails, or trigger automatic replies \r\nto contact requests with information that might solve their \r\nproblem. This is perhaps all a piece of cake to arrange with all-in-one marketing platforms like HubSpot."
