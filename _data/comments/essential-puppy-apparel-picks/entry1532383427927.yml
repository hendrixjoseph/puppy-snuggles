msg: "There are, in fact, some negative factors to freelancing.\r\nOne important level is that for those who work as a freelance paralegal you will not \r\nbe eligible for the varieties of benefits that youd have in working for a \r\nlaw firm or a non-public attorney. If you happen to \r\nreally feel that such “perks” as common medical health insurance and other \r\nsuch advantages are important, freelancing is not going \r\nto give you these benefits."
