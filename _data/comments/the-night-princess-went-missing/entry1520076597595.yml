  The thought of one of our pups going missing is one I think about with dread.
  I can only imagine how upset and worried you were for Princess, there is no
  way I'd be able to sleep either! How wonderful that your neighbour found her
  and kept her safe for you, the power of the internet is brilliant for these
  instances!
