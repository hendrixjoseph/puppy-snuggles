  Not knowing where your dog is can certainly be considered the worst feeling
  ever.  I lost a dog that I never found...have a feeling someone kept her.  She
  had been dumped at a hotel and I took her in.  I still wonder what happened to
  her.  I am so glad that you found her through Craig's list.  Social media has
  its plusses.
