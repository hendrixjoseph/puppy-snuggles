msg: "My developer is trying to persuade me to move to .net from \r\nPHP. I have always disliked the idea because of the costs.\r\nBut he's tryiong none the less. I've been using Movable-type on a number of websites for about a year and am nervous about switching \r\nto another platform. I have heard very good things about blogengine.net.\r\nIs there a way I can transfer all my wordpress posts into it?\r\nAny kind of help would be really appreciated! http://www.volvoonline.ru/bitrix/redirect.php?event1=&event2=&event3=&goto=http://alternatif188bet.com"
