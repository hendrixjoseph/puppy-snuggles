  Few things scarier than losing a dog. Kilo the Pug bolted a few times early on
  and nearly gave me a heart attack. He slipped his old harness but he came back
  very quickly as I keep bags of treats to shake by the doors. Thank goodness
  your neighbor took your dog in and then alerted you.  I found a beautiful lab
  lost on our street when I was picking up my daughter at 1.30am from a party
  once. We took her in after driving around looking and listening for an owner
  as it was snowing, windy and well below zero. I called the number on her
  collar in Florida (I was in Toronto). The next morning, my husband's best
  friend's Dad showed up so happy to find his beloved dog safe and sound. They
  had just returned from wintering south and she had run out the door a few
  blocks from our house and got lost in the snow. He had searched for hours
  right near us but just missed her. Microchips and Tags are so important.
