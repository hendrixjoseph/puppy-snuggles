  This is the kind of thing that my anxiety disordered brain uses for night
  terrors. SO glad it ends well. YIKES! What wonderful neighbours. I am still
  searching for a GPS tracker that is small enough for my 3.5 pounder to wear. I
  am lucky though ... we live in a condo. He would have to get out of the
  apartment, then down the elevator and out the fob needed to exit doors ...
  without being seen by the many people here that love him. But damn! When we
  travel - in foreign lands ... I admit I worry.
