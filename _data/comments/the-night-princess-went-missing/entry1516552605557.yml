  This literally almost brought me to tears. I have two fur babies who I would
  be absolutely sick if they were missing. When we are away and have others
  caring for them I’m always so scared something will happen to them. I will
  never forget a few years ago we were in Chicago (4 hour car ride) and as soon
  as we had gotten settled my mom called and said my little baby was throwing up
  and having seizures. I was immediately a hot mess, cried the whole way back,
  and drove straight to the hospital where she was. I’m sooo glad you found
  Princess!
