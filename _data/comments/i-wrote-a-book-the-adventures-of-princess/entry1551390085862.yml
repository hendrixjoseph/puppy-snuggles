msg: "We burn fat from parts of our own bodies irrespective of which body part we \r\ntarget. But you probably should start eating more nuts, whole oats, fruits, vegetables,\r\nfish, and stuff like that.  Your lifting weights sessions should not be any over 45 minutes, as well as the \r\nbest results, focus on proper form and find out the quantity of repetitions in line \r\nwith the goals you want to achieve."
