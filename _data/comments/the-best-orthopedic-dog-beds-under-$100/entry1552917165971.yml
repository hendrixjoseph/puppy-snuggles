msg: "Disclosure: I purchased my samples of Roja Dove’s Un Amore \r\nEterno, Grossmith’s Saffron Rose, and MFK’s Baccarat Rouge.\r\nSamples of all the other fragrances mentioned here were offered by the respective \r\nperfume companies, their brokers, or their distributors, with the exception of the LM Parfums samples which had been offered by Luckyscent.\r\nThe name is a play on Sergio Leone’s well-known movie, \"The Good, The Bad & The Ugly,\" however not \r\none of the fragrances lined here rise to the extent of truly \"good.\" Not \r\nby my requirements, or in my view. To a \"T.\" \r\nThe German Shepherd in me continues to grimace."
