  Maybe she can work as a goose chaser! I am a certified wildlife specialist and
  people hire me to oil the goose eggs so they won't hatch. Once I brought one
  of my springers with me to help with goose control. Since it was a business
  campus, I had her on a leash. Three large geese approached us and hissed. Poor
  Kaylee bolted the opposite way and got choked a bit with her collar - she
  wasn't a goose dog when they were aggressive and taller than her!
