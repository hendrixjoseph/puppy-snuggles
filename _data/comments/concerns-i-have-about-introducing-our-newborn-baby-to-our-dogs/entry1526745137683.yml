  If you need any support or ideas to help your dogs through the transition,
  please ask! There is a huge group of dog behavior counselors who are part of
  the Family Paws Parent Education program (myself included) who specialize in
  helping expectant families and their dogs, along with parents with toddlers
  and their dogs. You are already thinking about this transition, which puts you
  ahead of most people! Learning to read your dog's body language is key in
  helping to alleviate everyone's stress and improve safety for all. Good luck
  and congratulations on the new addition!
