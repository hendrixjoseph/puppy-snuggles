message: "I have always had dogs, even as a baby there was one in the house, but I think the one I remember the most as a child was Whiskey who we rescued off the streets of Israel and took her back to South Africa - that was in 1975 when things for pets were not as organized as today.\r\n\r\nSo I know how you feel, a home is not a home without a dog and what a wonderful way to have met your wife that way, as I am sure it made life a lot easier."
