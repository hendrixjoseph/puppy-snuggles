message: "What a beautiful tribute to the dogs you have loved!  I will always remember my childhood dog Ginny, she was so special, just like your Lobi.  We were so blessed to have dogs as children, they mean so much to us and give back in such a special way.  I too was devastated at losing her after 17 years of love.  I've loved both dogs & cats my whole life.  Wonderful post.\r\nLove & Biscuits,\r\nDogs Luv Us and We Luv Them"
