  Aww it's so lovely to 'meet' your dogs, it's amazing how dogs affect our lives
  and growing up. We had a dog when I was a teenage, I loved her dearly, then
  when I started work, I longed for a dog, its taken 25 years and we now have 2
  dogs (we didn't want to get a dog when we both worked such long hours). I love
  them and their different characters so much and can't imagine life without
  them.
