  Your dogs are beautiful, and how special to have such happy memories. I didn't
  grow up with animals, never had contact with them or had friends with animals.
  The first time I really interacted with one was when I was 25 and my then
  boyfriend brought a puppy over to "meet me." I've been in love with dogs and
  cats ever since. Who knew!!
