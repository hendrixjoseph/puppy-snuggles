## Google Analytics

I use Google Analytics to determine site traffic, sources of said traffic, and user behavior. Neither I nor this site will attempt to identify you personally using Google Analytics.

If you wish to know more or even opt out, view [Google's privacy policy](http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/).

## Advertising

### Goodle Adsense / Adwords

I run Google Adsense mainly to know how to use Adsense. This is the single ad banner you may see on the top of the page. My goal is to only ever have at most the single ad banner. Again, for more details, view [Google's privacy policy](http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/).

### Amazon Affiliate

This site participates in the [Amazon Services LLC Associates Program](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/help/operating/agreement), an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for this site to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.

## Social Media

### Comments

I use a Jekyll and GitHub Page commenting system known as [StaticMan](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/new-commenting-system-staticman/). Each comment requires a comment and an email. I never see the email nor saved it in plaintext. It is hashed and stored using MD5, which allows me to access profile images associated with the email via [Gravatar](https://www.gravatar.com).

### Share

Each post currently has five share links: Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Google+, Reddit, and StumbleUpon. Sharing a post requires an account with the associated service as well as adherence to their privacy policies.
