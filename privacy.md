## Google Analytics

I use Google Analytics to determine site traffic, sources of said traffic, and user behavior. Neither I nor this site will attempt to identify you personally using Google Analytics.

I also have demographics enabled on Google Analytics, which only tells me aggregated information on users' age, gender, and interests.

If you wish to know more or even opt out, view [Google's privacy policy](http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/).

## Facebook Pixel

I currently use Facebook Conversion Tracking Pixels. This allows me to see visits on my website via Facebook, as well as to target Facebook ads to people who've visited this website.

View [Facebook's privacy policy](https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/) for more details. Facebook also has an [Ad Preferences page](https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/) giving you control over your data.

## Advertising

### Goodle Adsense / Adwords

I run Google Adsense mainly to know how to use Adsense. This is the single ad banner you may see on the top of the page. My goal is to only ever have at most the single ad banner. Again, for more details, view [Google's privacy policy](http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/).

### Amazon Affiliate

This site participates in the [Amazon Services LLC Associates Program](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/help/operating/agreement), an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for this site to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.

## Social Media

### Comments

I use a Jekyll and GitHub Page commenting system known as [StaticMan](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/new-commenting-system-staticman/). Each comment requires a comment and an email. I never see the email nor saved it in plaintext. It is hashed and stored using MD5, which allows me to access profile images associated with the email via [Gravatar](https://www.gravatar.com).

There is no requirement that the email or name be real.

If you want a comment removed, contact me at contact@puppy-snuggles.com with the e-mail address and permalink of the comment you wish to have removed. The permalink can be found by clicking on the date of the comment. For instance, the following is a comment permalink: [https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/new-commenting-system-staticman/#comment-1510760200](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/new-commenting-system-staticman/#comment-1510760200).

If you want all comments removed with an associated email, contact me with the email and I will remove them.

### Share

Each post currently has six share links: Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Google+, Reddit, and Mix. Sharing a post requires an account with the associated service as well as adherence to their privacy policies.
