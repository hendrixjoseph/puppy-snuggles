## Google Analytics

I use Google Analytics to determine site traffic, sources of said traffic, and user behavior. Neither I nor this site will attempt to identify you personally using Google Analytics.

If you wish to know more or even opt out, view [Google's privacy policy](http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/).

## Advertising

### Goodle Adsense / Adwords

I run Google Adsense mainly to know how to use Adsense. This is the single ad banner you may see on the top of the page. My goal is to only ever have at most the single ad banner. Again, for more details, view [Google's privacy policy](http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/).

## Social Media

### Comments

The comment section underneath most of the posts is Facebook's comment plugin. To post comments requires a Facebook account and adherence to [Facebook's Data Policy](https://www.facebook.com/policy.php).
