There are several types of dog leashes available, each with their own specific features and benefits. Here are some common types of dog leashes:

## Standard Leash

This is the most basic type of leash and is usually made of nylon or leather. It is a simple, one-piece leash that is attached to the collar or harness of the dog.

## Retractable Leash

This type of leash is a long, flexible leash that is housed in a plastic or metal casing. It has a locking mechanism that allows the owner to adjust the length of the leash as needed.

## Hands-Free Leash

This type of leash is worn around the owner's waist and allows them to have their hands free while walking their dog. It is often used by runners or hikers.

## Coupler Leash

This leash - sometimes also called a double leash - is used to walk two dogs at the same time. It has two separate leashes that are connected in the middle, allowing the owner to walk both dogs with a single hand.

## Traffic Leash

This leash is a short leash (usually four to six feet long) that is used when walking a dog in a crowded or busy area. It allows the owner to have more control over the dog and keep them close to them.

## Training Leash

This leash is a long leash (usually fifteen to thirty feet long) that is used for obedience training or other types of training. It allows the dog to have more freedom to move around while still being under the owner's control.
