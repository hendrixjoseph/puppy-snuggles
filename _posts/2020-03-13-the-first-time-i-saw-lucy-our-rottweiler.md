It was a regular summer day - warm, sunny skies and perfect for a walk. It was during that walk that I realized I had to convince my husband that we needed a dog! I so badly wanted to have a furry little pup to accompany me on my outdoor adventures. I longed for a pup to walk daily, but also for some summer fun. 

So, the first words out of my mouth when we returned from our leisurely walk was "Honey, we need to get a dog!"

The next day we went online and started searching for our perfect pup. I knew I wanted a larger breed that would protect me and help make me feel comfortable enough to go for walks and not worry about my safety. I also knew I wanted one that had a sweet personality and would be extremely loyal to our family. We went through various online platforms to help us find a pooch. 

We looked at a few contenders on [Petfinder](https://www.petfinder.com/). We also hit up the shelters, but I needed a companion that was strong, bold, and known for being a great guardian. We ultimately decided against adopting from a shelter because we were afraid of getting an improperly trained pup that might snap at our six-year-old daughter.

At this point, we now knew that we had to resort to the Internet to find the perfect addition to our family. Finally, after days of online searching, we came across an ad from a cute little Mennonite family that had a Rottweiler named Beatrice who just had a litter of purebred puppies.

They. Were. CUTE!

I initially wanted a male dog since I feel that they are better for protection reasons and, to be completely honest, cheaper to get fixed. However, when we went to visit these pups, I was immediately drawn to the little on cowering the corner. She was the only puppy that didn't try to jump out of the fence and was looking for my attention but didn't want to be too aggressive it was at that very moment that I knew that one was our pup!

So my pup turned out to be female - which was not my first choice - but it didn't matter as I knew she was our perfect match. She was the sweetest little thing and snuggled right up to my daughter and me! She was just so happy and grateful to be with us. When we got her home she seemed scared, but she warmed up to us and adjusted rather quickly. Her favorite thing to do was curl up by her food bowl to make sure nobody stole it! She also loved to run around our dining room table. 

We named her Lucy and it wasn't long before this pup won over our hearts and souls and become the newest member of our little family.

I couldn't be happier with the way everything turned out and today she is three years old and still loving life, chasing deer, and, of course, making memories!
