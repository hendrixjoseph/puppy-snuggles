I wrote a book! A children's book, in fact. Which means I did illustrations, as well.

It's a short book - only seventeen pages. And it's only available an ebook on Kindle via Amazon. I have it set to be read free via Kindle Unlimited and loanable via the Kindle Ownersâ€™ Lending Library. Other words it's 99&cent;, although I have the option to occasionally make it completely free.

The book is called [The Adventures of Princess](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07M68STB4/?tag=puppysnuggles-20) and is a (somewhat) fictionalized account about how my wife and I met through the perspective of my dog, Princess.
