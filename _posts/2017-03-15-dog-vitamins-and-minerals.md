Just like us humans, dogs need a complete and balanced diet, which includes getting essential vitamins and minerals. Fortunately, most store-bought dog foods contain the balance needed, [according to WebMD](http://pets.webmd.com/dogs/guide/dog-vitamins-and-supplements).

### What Vitamins and Minerals Do Dogs Need?

#### Vitamins for Dogs

The list of vitamins for dogs is very similar to the list of vitamins for humans. They are, in alphabetical order (not importance!):

1. Vitamin A
2. Vitamin B1 (Thiamine)
3. Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin)
4. Vitamin B3 (Niacin)
5. Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine)
6. Vitamin B9 (Folate, Folic Acid)
7. Vitamin B12 (Cyanocobalamin)
8. Vitamin C (Ascorbic acid)
9. Vitamin D
10. Vitamin E
11. Vitamin K

#### Minerals for Dogs

Important [minerals your dog needs](http://www.petmd.com/dog/nutrition/evr_dg_mineral-the_right_sources) are again similar to what humans need. Again, in alphabetical order rather than importance, these are:

1. Calcium
2. Chromium
3. Copper
4. Fluorine
5. Iodine
6. Iron
7. Magnesium
8. Manganese
9. Phosphorous
10. Potassium
11. Selenium
12. Sodium and Chloride (Sodium Chloride, a.k.a. table salt)
13. Sulfur
14. Zinc

Before you head to the dog vitamin aisle at your local pet store or [browse Amazon for supplements](http://amzn.to/2m1r6Ld), keep in mind that *too much* of any one of these vitamins and minerals can hurt your dog just as bad as not having enough. Chances are, as stated in the intro paragraph, your dog already gets enough from the dog food you give him every day.

### When Should I Give My Dog Vitamin and Mineral Supplements?

Generally, there are four reasons you may want to give your dog a vitamin or mineral supplement, according to [Cesar Milan's website](https://www.cesarsway.com/dog-care/nutrition/dog-vitamins-and-supplements):

1. Your dog has a vitamin or mineral deficiency.
2. Your dog has a disease that is treated with a supplement.
3. You cook your dog his food.
4. Your dog's joints ache.

In any of the above situations, or you have any doubts, you should always consult your dog's veterinarian first.

### What Kind of Dog Food Do I Feed My Dog?

I used to feed my dog Kroger brand dog food (which was called "Old Yeller" at the time), however, when I read the reviews (the most positive review said "it could be worse - you could be starving your dog") and talked to my veterinarian, I realized I needed something better. I switched to [Purina One](http://amzn.to/2nbdfSf) and haven't gone back - and my dog enjoys it thoroughly!

Here are some of the varieties of Purina One:
