Just for fun, I've decided to run a little giveaway contest. This contest is administered by Amazon, so they're doing all the heavy lifting.

So what is the prize and how do you get a chance to win? The prize is the following t-shirt I designed:

[![I Love My Dog T-Shirt](http://www.puppy-snuggles.com/images/covers/2017-05-01-i-love-my-dog-t-shirt-contest.jpg)](http://amzn.to/2pRiHvl)
