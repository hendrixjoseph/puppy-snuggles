Just for fun, I've decided to run a little giveaway contest. This contest is administered by Amazon, so they're doing all the heavy lifting.

So what is the prize and how do you get a chance to win? The prize is the following t-shirt I designed:

[![I Love My Dog T-Shirt](https://www.puppy-snuggles.com/images/covers/2017-05-01-i-love-my-dog-t-shirt-contest.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XJD5S56/)

You'll have to follow my Twitter page [*Puppy Snuggles*](https://twitter.com/puppy_snuggles). You should be able to enter even if you're already following me. Just follow the instructions in the above link.

This giveaway started May 1, 2017 3:13 PM PDT and ends May 6, 2017 11:59 PM PDT.
