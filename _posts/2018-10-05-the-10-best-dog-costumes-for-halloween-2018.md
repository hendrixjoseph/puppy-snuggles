It's October, which means that the Halloween season is upon us. For many people that means haunted attractions, pumpkin carving, trick-or-treat, and Halloween parties. Those last two - trick-or-treat and Halloween parties - mean that's it's time to dress up in awesome Halloween costumes.

Don't forget to get a Halloween costume for your furry family member! Here are ten of the best dog costumes you can dress your pup in this Halloween:

## [Prison Dog Halloween Costume](https://www.amazon.com/Casual-Canine-Prison-Dog-Halloween-Costume/dp/B000W5UWPQ/?tag=puppysnuggles-20)

Not that you'd ever send your dog to jail or prison - she's much too spoiled for that! Still, this quick-and-easy Halloween costume is super-cute and adorable.

Is your dog a sneaky little bugger, always getting into treats (and shoes) when he shouldn't? Maybe you should dress him up in this Pirate Halloween costume since he always seems to be getting into things he shouldn't!

It's a good thing he's adorable, right?

## [Dog Shark Halloween Costume](https://www.amazon.com/Dog-Shark-Halloween-Costume/dp/B00JSMVMOE/?tag=puppysnuggles-20)

This Halloween costume is great for anyone with human children who are into that whole [Baby Shark song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqZsoesa55w). You could even add your own verse - Doggy Shark  Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo!

## [Panda Dog Halloween Costume](https://www.amazon.com/Pandaloon-Panda-Dog-Halloween-Costume/dp/B075QZV33C/?tag=puppysnuggles-20)

Of course, sharks aren't the only animal you can dress your dog as this Halloween. You could also dress your furry one as a super-cute Panda Bear!

## [Dog Lion Mane Halloween Costume](https://www.amazon.com/Dog-Lion-Mane-Halloween-Costume/dp/B00UXVNIBE/?tag=puppysnuggles-20)

[![Dog Lion Mane Halloween Costume](/images/halloween-costumes/2018/dog-lion-mane-halloween-costume.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/Dog-Lion-Mane-Halloween-Costume/dp/B00UXVNIBE/?tag=puppysnuggles-20)

Is the Panda Bear too cute and the Doggy Shark too silly? Want something a little more fearsome and ferocious? Simply put this lion mane on your pup for a quick, easy - and eye-catching - Halloween costume!

## [Bat Dog Halloween Costume](https://www.amazon.com/Bat-Dog-Halloween-Costume/dp/B07H7C2Y7D/?tag=puppysnuggles-20)

Of course, you can always turn your dog into a cute vampire bat with some bat-wings.

While your dog is a bat dog, he's not quite [batdog](https://www.amazon.com/Batman-Dog-Halloween-Costume/dp/B00UCIWNV4/?tag=puppysnuggles-20), Batman's canine companion...

## [Superman Dog Halloween Costume](https://www.amazon.com/DC-Comics-Superman-Dog-Halloween-Costume/dp/B00KGHZZ0M/?tag=puppysnuggles-20)

[![Superman Dog Halloween Costume](/images/halloween-costumes/2018/superman-dog-halloween-costume.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/DC-Comics-Superman-Dog-Halloween-Costume/dp/B00KGHZZ0M/?tag=puppysnuggles-20)

Speaking of dog superheroes, you can always through on a Superman costume. Superman, of course, is the superhero identity of Daily Planet News reporter Clark Kent. I guess that means you could call your dog "Bark Kent"? (Seriously, though, Superman did have a ["Superdog" named Krypto](https://www.amazon.com/Kryptos-Scripto/dp/B00D5P15BK/?tag=puppysnuggles-20)

## [Iron Man Dog Halloween Costume](https://www.amazon.com/Iron-Man-Dog-Halloween-Costume/dp/B07FB3C4NT/?tag=puppysnuggles-20)

[![Iron Man Dog Halloween Costume](/images/halloween-costumes/2018/iron-man-dog-halloween-costume.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/Iron-Man-Dog-Halloween-Costume/dp/B07FB3C4NT/?tag=puppysnuggles-20)

Following the superhero theme - and keeping in mind one of the biggest superhero movies this year was [Avengers: Infinity War](https://www.amazon.com/Avengers-Infinity-War/dp/B07CKK1LT3/?tag=puppysnuggles-20) - dressing your dog up as Tony Stark in his Iron Man suit is sure to be a hit. I guess since I dogified Superman, you could call your dog Iron Dog or Tony Bark?

## [Marvel Deadpool Dog Halloween Costume](https://www.amazon.com/Marvel-Deadpool-Dog-Halloween-Costume/dp/B079QCK4K9/?tag=puppysnuggles-20)

[![Marvel Deadpool Dog Halloween Costume](/images/halloween-costumes/2018/marvel-deadpool-dog-halloween-costume.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/Marvel-Deadpool-Dog-Halloween-Costume/dp/B079QCK4K9/?tag=puppysnuggles-20)

Another popular movie that came out this year was [Deadpool 2](https://www.amazon.com/Deadpool-2-Ryan-Reynolds/dp/B07D5KWFJ7/?tag=puppysnuggles-20). Thankfully, your dog will behave just a good in this costume as she does out. She won't become potty-mouthed with crude humor and a sudden awareness of that fourth wall.

## [Disney Incredibles Dog Halloween Costume](https://www.amazon.com/Disney-Incredibles-Dog-Halloween-Costume/dp/B07D4RW136/?tag=puppysnuggles-20)

[![Disney Incredibles Dog Halloween Costume](/images/halloween-costumes/2018/disney-incredibles-dog-halloween-costume.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/Disney-Incredibles-Dog-Halloween-Costume/dp/B07D4RW136/?tag=puppysnuggles-20)

However, if you do want your dog to dress up as a more wholesome, family-friendly superhero, but still want it to be from a movie that came out this year, you can always dress him as a member of the Incredibles. The Disney Pixar movie [Incredibles 2](https://www.amazon.com/Incredibles-2/dp/B07DNL1DC8/?tag=puppysnuggles-20) came out earlier this year, so dressing him up as one of the Incredible family is sure to be a hit!
