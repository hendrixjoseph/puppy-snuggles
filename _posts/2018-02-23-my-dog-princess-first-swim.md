My dog [Princess](https://www.puppy-snuggles.com/blog/puppy-profile-princess/) is a pit/golden retriever mix and absolutely loves the water. Whenever my wife and I go hiking with our dogs, if we go next to a creek or pond, Princess will instantly want to head in that direction. Amazingly enough, she never got a chance to swim until just before she turned seven years old.

Even before I met my wife, I enjoyed taking walks and hiking. Princess, of course, loved going on walks with me. The vast majority of our walks were short. To me, a 45 minute or hour long walk or hike was a long one.

But then I met my wife, an avid lover of hikes. And not just any hikes - well, yes, she loves any hike - but long hikes. To her, a 45 minute or hour long hike is a *short* hike. So my *long* hikes are her *short* hikes.

In addition to hiking, my wife and I enjoy other outdoorsy things. Things like camping and canoeing. Shortly after we started dating, her sister asked if we would like to join her on a canoe trip with friends. And *we could bring the dogs.*

At this point, Princess had never been swimming. I didn't even know if she knew how to swim! So naturally, I was a bit concerned - I didn't want her to fall off the canoe and drown!

So I drove down to the local pet store and bought her a [doggy life jacket](https://www.chewy.com/s?query=doggy%20life%20jacket). On top of making it safer for it, she looked super cute in it. She gets lots of comments every time she wears it!

In hindsight, she probably doesn't really need the doggy life jacket. Not only can she swim, she's a super swimmer and absolutely loves the water!

When we took a lunch break on our canoe trip, Princess spent the whole time swimming in circles. She wasn't swimming because she had to, she was swimming because she wanted to!

Even though it's been almost four years since Princess had her first swim, I still have the doggy life jacket and have used it when we went canoeing again.

She gets plenty of chances to swim now that I know that she loves it. She has swam in creeks, rivers, streams, ponds, lakes, and even swimming pools.

I feel a bit bad that I did not introduce her to swimming earlier, but I am grateful she has plenty of opportunities to swim now!
