Pit bulls (sometimes spelled as a compound word pitbulls) are a type of dog distinguished by a stocky frame, muscular build, and short face. They were initially bred by combining [bulldogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulldog) and [terriers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrier) together. Initially used for blood sports such as [bear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear-baiting) and [bull-baiting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bull-baiting), they later became used as companion animals and [catch dogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch_dog) in hunting as the blood sports became illegal. Sadly, they have also been used in illegal dog fighting as well.

The pit bull isn't [one specific breed](http://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/american-pit-bull-terrier). In fact, the term is sometimes used to label pit-bull mixes. That said, there are generally considered to be four major breeds of a pit bull: the American Pit Bull Terrier, the American Staffordshire Terrier, the American Bully, and the Staffordshire Bull Terrier.
