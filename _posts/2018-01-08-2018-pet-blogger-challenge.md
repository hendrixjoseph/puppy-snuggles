The [***Pet Blogger Challange***](https://blog.gopetfriendly.com/8th-annual-pet-blogger-challenge-coming-january-6th-7th-and-8th/) is a set of questions by [the Go Pet Friendly blog](https://blog.gopetfriendly.com/) for bloggers to answer over the weekend of January 6th, 7th, & 8th. While this is the 8th annual Pet Blogger Challenge there, this is my first.

Here are the questions and my answers:

### 1. For those who may be visiting your blog for the first time, how long have you been blogging and what is your main topic?

I've been blogging for probably over a decade. I've only been pet-blogging specifically since February 8, 2017, when I published [the intro post for this blog](http://www.puppy-snuggles.com/blog/introducing-puppy-snuggles/).

The main topic of Puppy Snuggles is anything dog related, mostly with a positive message.

### 2. What was your proudest blogging moment of 2017?

Starting Puppy Snuggles! I haven't done super well with this blog, but I have done moderately well with the social media aspect, especially Facebook and Twitter.

### 3. Which of your blog posts was your favorite this year and why?

Probably [Princess versus the Sliding Glass Door](http://www.puppy-snuggles.com/blog/princess-versus-the-sliding-glass-door/) as it indicated a shift in the blog's focus from being information and advice-oriented to being story oriented.

### 4. In terms of your blog, how do you measure success?

Right now, just the ability to post frequently enough with posts that I feel are high quality. Last year I only made 21 posts, which is not quite two a month.

### 5. In what ways has your blog changed during 2017?

My focus switched from trying to give advice to writing stories.

### 6. What was the biggest blogging challenge you overcame in 2017, and what did you learn that could help other bloggers?

Initially, I was trying to give advice and provide detailed analysis. I finally decided it would be better to write more story-oriented blog posts.

### 7. When things get hard, what keeps you blogging?

It's fun. I do it a lot to develop my writing skills. I also really like dogs.

### 8. Looking forward to 2018, what are you hoping to accomplish on your blog this year?

I would like to make more posts and have more engagement.

### 9. In addition to what you’d like to accomplish, is here one specific skill you’d like to improve or master this year?

Perhaps get better at writing prose. I might even post some fiction blog posts. Of course, I'll let people know those stories are mostly fiction.
