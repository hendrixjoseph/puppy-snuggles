Like most pet owners, my wife and I like to take our dogs on frequent walks and hikes. While walks on a leash are fine, but it's nice to be able to take them somewhere off leash. Thankfully the [Montgomery County Bark Park](https://www.mcohio.org/departments/animal_resource_center/bark_park.php), a repurposed landfill, is close by.

Last Friday I made a [daring early escape from the office](https://local.theonion.com/employee-executes-daring-3-30-p-m-escape-from-office-1819576604) so I could round up the pups and take them to the Bark Park before my wife got off work and while my son was probably napping at daycare.

We stayed at the Bark Park for a little over an hour. I wanted to wait long enough to have my wife get our son and meet us there, but [Princess](https://www.puppy-snuggles.com/blog/puppy-profile-princess/) was getting tired. [Niko](https://www.puppy-snuggles.com/blog/puppy-profile-niko/), being younger, still had plenty of energy.

Of course, I snapped some pictures of the pups playing and making friends!
