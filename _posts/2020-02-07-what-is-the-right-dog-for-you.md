Dogs truly are a man's best friend. They are loyal, loving, kind, and fun. What is not to love about that? But one thing people often overlook when planning to add a furry friend to their family: the type and breed of dog. This can make a huge difference in the temperament and personality of your future pup. This animal will be a family member for life, so you must choose the right one that will fit into your family. There are many different breeds of dogs. Determining which one is ideal for you and your family begins with assessing what kinds of behaviors and traits you want your furry friend to have. 

## Energetic and High Activity Dogs

For some families, a high energy dog that loves exercise and the outdoors is ideal because they can not only keep up with an active family but also help keep the family active in the first place. If you're young and have children that love to do outdoorsy things, then you might want a fun, energetic dog that loves to go for walks and go camping with the family. If you choose a breed such as a Labrador, Golden Retriever, or Boxer they are more likely to exude these types of behaviors. So if your looking for an outdoor buddy that will keep you in shape, choosing one of these breeds might be a good fit for you.

## Protective Dogs

For single people, living alone, finding a furry friend that can offer protection and security may be a good idea. Breeds such as German Shepherds, Pit Bulls, and Rottweilers are all known for being protective, loyal breeds. These types of pups are great because not only do they protect you and guard you against outside threats, but they are also super lovable and affectionate. Although these breeds can commonly be misunderstood, their behavior depends on how they were raised and cared for. If you're living alone or just simply want some extra protection for your home and family, choose one of these sweet yet strong breeds. 

## Lethargic and Mild Mannered Dogs 

For some people, high strung, energetic dogs may not be a good fit. Those dogs may be fun for a while, but maintaining a pup like that takes a lot more work and effort than one who prefers to lounge around the house. Lazy pups still need daily exercise to stay healthy, but less than extremely energetic dogs. Canine breeds such as Pugs, Mastiffs, Shih Tzus, and Dachshunds are all fairly low key, mild-mannered dogs that do not require as much exercise. They are cute, cuddly, and fun but without the hyperactivity and daily maintenance needed to keep their energy levels at bay. They are great for small children and the elderly that just need a pup that is not hyper and easy to care for. 

When choosing your fur baby, be sure to consider these things and take into account what type of pup will fit in well with your family so that not only you and your family can be happy but your pup will be happy too!
