1. We aren’t going on long walks every day.
2. We’re not going out hunting all day, either.
3. Neither are we hanging out at the dog park all day.
4. We are coming back.
5. If you’d just let us have the ball, we’d throw it. That’s what you want, anyway, right?
6. We miss you when we’re away.
7. We wish we could take you with us to work.

9. That treat we give you every month is actually medicine.
10. There’s secretly a pill in this piece of bologna.
