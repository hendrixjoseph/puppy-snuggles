Maybe your pup has had a long, hard day playing. Maybe she's gotten a little older and her joints aren't what they used to be. Either way, your pup deserves the best, most restful sleep she can get - and the best sleep she can get is on an orthopedic dog bed.

## What is an Orthopedic Dog Bed?

An orthopedic dog bed is a type of dog bed specially designed to help support your dog's joints, back, and body. These dog beds help a sore and achy pup sleep more comfortably, regardless if those aches and pains are simply from a long day of playing or just old age.

Searching for such a dog bed can be a bit overwhelming, so I searched Amazon for orthopedic dog beds under $100 with at least 1,000 reviews. Additionally, the average review score had to be over 4.0 (out of 5.0). You can check out the search page via [this link](https://amzn.to/2RyEj9D).

Below are the top five orthopedic dog beds under $100 with over 1,000 reviews on Amazon:
