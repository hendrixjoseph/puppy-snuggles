Ever wonder how common your dog's name is? Unlike human names, there's not as complete a list (for instance, [the US Social Security website](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/) contains a list of popular baby names). However, there are a couple of sources.

For instance, [Rover.com published a list last November](https://www.rover.com/blog/100-most-popular-male-female-dog-names-2016/) of the 100 most popular (or should I say "**pup**ular?") dog names they had in their database. 

### Top five male dog names from Rover.com

1. Max
2. Charlie
3. Buddy
4. Cooper
5. Jack

### Top five female dog names from Rover.com

1. Bella
2. Lucy
3. Daisy
4. Lola
5. Luna

[My dog Princess](http://www.puppy-snuggles.com/blog/puppy-profile-princess/) is number 43. My fianc&eacute;e's dog Niko didn't make the list.

Another source of dog names come from pet insurance. They most recent list I found was from [dogtime.com](http://dogtime.com/top-100-dog-names). This list is from 2013.

### Top five male dog names from dogtime.com

1. Bailey
2. Max
3. Charlie
4. Buddy
5. Rocky

### Top five female dog names from dogtime.com

1. Bella
2. Lucy
3. Molly
4. Daisy
5. Maggie

This time Princess did better at number 20. Again, Niko did not make the list.

It's interesting to see that Max, Charlie, and Buddy made the list for both lists of top five male dogs names, and Bella, Lucy, and Daisy made the list of top five female dogs names.

What's your dog's name? Did they make the list?
