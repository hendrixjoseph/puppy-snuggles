It's been a fun first year here at Puppy Snuggles. While we only published 20 blog posts (a little over one blog post a month) starting with [our introduction post on February 8th](http://www.puppy-snuggles.com/blog/introducing-puppy-snuggles/), we've had great success with our social media. As of this writing, we have [3,893 followers on Twitter](https://twitter.com/puppy_snuggles), [451 likes on Facebook](http://fb.me/puppysnuggle), [48 followers on Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/puppysnuggles12/), and [53 followers on our newly-launched Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/puppy.snuggles/)!

To recap 2017, here are the top five Puppy Snuggles posts of 2017, based on page views in Google Analytics:

Not surprisingly the post with the most views was published earlier in the year since the earlier posts are published the more time people have to view them. It's nice to see two posts published in the latter half of the year in this list, though.

Onward to 2018!
