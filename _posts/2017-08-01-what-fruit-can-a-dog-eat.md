Your dog probably watches you intently whenever you eat, no matter what you eat. This normally raises the question what human food can a dog eat? In this blog post, I identify some common fruits that are okay for a dog to eat - and some fruits that are dangerous.

Keep in mind that fruit is often high in sugar, so you don't necessarily want to give your best friend an excess amount of any of these. Also, check [my source over at AKC's website](http://www.akc.org/content/health/articles/fruits-vegetables-dogs-can-and-cant-eat/) for more details.

Finally, being that there are perhaps thousands of different fruits, this list is by no way exhaustive.
