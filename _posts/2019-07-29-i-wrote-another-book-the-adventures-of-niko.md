Late last year [I published a book](https://www.puppy-snuggles.com/blog/i-wrote-a-book-the-adventures-of-princess/) called [The Adventures of Princess](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07M68STB4/?tag=puppysnuggles-20). Well, I've recently written and published another book!

The book I wrote - [The Adventures of Niko](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SRJTTMW/?tag=puppysnuggles-20) - is neither a sequel nor prequel to the other one. Instead, it's a companion book to *The Adventures of Princess*.

It tells the same events of *The Adventures of Princess* but through the eyes of Niko, my wife's dog.

I set the price to be the same - 99&cent;. It is also free via [Kindle Unlimited](https://amzn.to/2AFJoXF) and loanable via the Kindle Ownersâ€™ Lending Library.

Not to leave anyone hanging, here is the cover:
